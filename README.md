# Support_Vector_Machine-SVM-

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be employed  for both regression and classification
SVM is based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides the dataset into two classes 
Objective of svm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points

In this project our task is to predict if the bank currency is authentic or not based on the four attributes given in the dataset
so X is my independent variable so I drop the target column and place it in y
Then I test_train_split the data. The fit method of SVC is called to train the algorithm on training data.

Then Evaluate the algorithm using confusion matrix, precision, recall and F1 measures are the most commonly used metrics for classification 
tasks.
